# DQN-CartPole-TF

This repository contains scripts for implementation of DQN created from scratch using Tensorflow 2. Short description of the files:
* DQN.py - RL agent and learning algorithm
* dqn-cart-pole.py - learn agent
* evaluate-cart-pole.py - evaluate agent over many episodes
* record-game-replay.py - run agent and save the replay

The video bellow represents the agent learning with progressing epochs.
